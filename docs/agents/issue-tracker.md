# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

The repository is `hamadmohsen/quests`; `gh` infers it from the GitHub remote when run inside this clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, retaining only external contributor associations.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve a bare `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, then fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Skill operations

- **Publish to the issue tracker**: create a GitHub issue.
- **Fetch the relevant ticket**: run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is one issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: a GitHub sub-issue, falling back to a task-list link plus `Part of #<map>`. Apply `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`).
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies. Where unavailable, use a `Blocked by: #<n>` line.
- **Frontier query**: choose the first open, unblocked, unassigned child in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`; this is the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child, then add its context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
